== About Classix ==

Classix is an ICD-10 code lookup application. Currently it searches for 
arbitrary text in code (eg "E11"), title (eg "Diabetes mellitus não-insulino-
dependente"), and inclusion notes (eg "Nota: Usar código adicional  de causa 
externa (Capítulo XX), se necessário, para identificar a droga, se induzido por 
droga."). It doesn't search in exclusion notes, on purpose. Currently it only 
supports the Brazilian Portuguese version of ICD-10.

The name comes from "classification" (the "C" in ICD-10) and from "X", the roman
numeral for 10.


== Dependencies ==

To run Classix you'll need python 2.5 or newer, with libsqlite3-0 (which is 
almost always a dependency of python2.5 or newer); python-gtk2 2.10 or newer; 
and python-gobject 2.12 or newer.

To build from the source code package, you'll need also intltool 0.40 or newer; 
and m4, autotools-dev, autoconf and automake. Installing intltool may 
bring the latter packages as dependencies.

To build from the Subversion repository, you'll need all of the above, plus 
gnome-common and libglib2.0-dev.

The package names vary a little from one GNU/Linux distribution to another.

== How to build it ==

Ideally, you should get a binary package for you distribution. If that's not 
possible, unpack the source code package, change to the new directory and run 
these commands:

./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

You can also run "sudo make uninstall" from the same directory.

If you check out the source code from the Subversion repository, you'll need to 
replace the first command with "./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr"
