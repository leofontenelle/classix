Classix is an ICD-10 code lookup application. Currently it searches for 
arbitrary text in code (eg "E11"), title (eg "Diabetes mellitus não-insulino-
dependente"), and inclusion notes (eg "Nota: Usar código adicional  de causa 
externa (Capítulo XX), se necessário, para identificar a droga, se induzido por 
droga."). It doesn't search in exclusion notes, on purpose. Currently it only 
supports the Brazilian Portuguese version of ICD-10.
