== About Classix ==

Classix is an ICD-10 code lookup application. It searches for the 
given words in the condition code ("E11"), name or description. It 
uses only the Brazilian Portuguese version of ICD-10.

The name comes from "classification" (the "C" in ICD-10) and from "X",
the roman numeral for 10.


== Dependencies ==

Compile time: gee >= 0.6
              glib >= 2.24
              gtk+ >= 3.0
              vala >= 0.14

Run time: gee, gtk+ and glib

== How to build it ==

Ideally, you should get a binary package for you distribution. If 
that's not possible, unpack the source code package, change to the new
directory and run these commands:

./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

You can also run "sudo make uninstall" from the same directory.

If you check out the source code from the Subversion repository, you'll
need to replace the first command with "./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr", and
will have another compile time dependency: gnome-common.
