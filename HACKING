- Code: in example, A06.0.
- Title: in example, "Disenteria amebiana aguda" (acute amebian
         disentery)
- Inclusion notes: synonyms, definition, variations of the conditions.
- Exclusion notes: similar conditions that have different codes.

How to use the data files
=========================

1. CID10N4A.DIC

Each line contains a word that can be present on the code, on the 
title, or on the inclusion notes, but not on the exclusion notes; and a
number that you can use to do a file seek at the INV file.

2. CID10N4A.INV

Use the number from the DIC file, and seek to that position. Read an
int32 (signed, little endian) and you'll know how many 32-bit integers
you'll have to read. Each integer will be used to do a file seek in the
DAT file.

3. CID10N4A.DAT

Using the integers from INV you can seek to the beginning of the
corresponding lines in the DAT files. The line format is described by
the dat_regex variable in classix.vala, with the following pattern:

"""^(?P<code>[A-Z][\d]{2}(\.[\d-])?[\x{2020}*]?)  """  +
"""(?P<title>[^|]*)\|  """                             +
"""(?P<inclusion_notes>(\| [^|\\]*)*)?"""              +
"""(\\ (?P<exclusion_notes>[^|]*(\| [^|]*)*))?"""

Where \x{2020} stands for the dagger symbol.
