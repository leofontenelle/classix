=============
Version 0.3.1
=============

===========
Version 0.3

  actually a toolbar).
* Moved the toolbar be to the bottom of the window in the Maemo environment.
* Made Classix able to save the search results to a text file.

* Made the command line interface work in Maemo.


===========
Version 0.2

* Improved the search speed 2 to 50 times by indexing the database. This is 
  specially true for computers with less RAM.
* Added full screen mode: press F11 on regular computers, or FullScreen (F6) in 
  internet tablets and other computers using the Hildon toolkit.
* Added command line interface (not working on Maemo, only regular computers).
